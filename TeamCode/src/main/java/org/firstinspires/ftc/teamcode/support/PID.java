    // kP
    // The proportional term or Kp is a value that is directly proportional to the error of the system.
    // To get the Proportional output, we take the Kp * error and add it to our system's input.
    // Changing Kp determines how fast or how slow the system moves towards 0 error.
    // You can think of Kp like a rubber band, where the thicker it is,
    // the harder it is to pull away from its equilibrium point.

    // kD
    // The derivative term or Kd is a value directly proportional to the rate of change of the error of the system.
    // To calculate this, we can find the slope of the error from the last update to the current update of the loop.
    // Derivative ensures that our system isn't responding too quickly by penalizing excessive rates of change.
    // You can think of Kd as increasing the friction of your skates on an ice skating rink.
    // The lower the friction, the harder to control, and you need a little bit of dampening to allow you
    // to keep yourself stable.

    // kI
    // The Integral term or Ki is directly proportional to the sum of all the errors over time.
    // This allows the system to overcome nonlinear effects such as static friction that would otherwise
    // be difficult to tune out. This works by adding up the remaining error until the output grows large enough
    // to overcome the constant disturbance.
